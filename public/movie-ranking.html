<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</h3>
<p>A classic romcom starring Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey./p>

<h3>10 Things I Hate About You</h3>
<p>Another romcom with 10 in the title makes it into my top three list.</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>A significantly different vibe than the other two films on this list, but similar to 10 Things I Hate About You, The Dark Knight stars Heath Ledger.</p>
